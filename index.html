                <p>     Structure components such as columns and struts are subjected to compressive load in applications. These components are made of high compressive strength materials. Not all the materials are strong in compression. Many materials poor in tension are good in compression. Cast iron is one such example. This strength is determined by conducting a compression test. </p>
